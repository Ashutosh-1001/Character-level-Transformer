# Character-level-Transformer
This project implements a Transformer-based character-level language model in PyTorch for generating text. Unlike traditional word-level models, this approach learns patterns at the character level, making it suitable for creative text generation, low-resource languages, and synthetic data augmentation.

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ… Transformer from scratch â€“ Implements self-attention, multi-head attention, and feed-forward layers.
âœ… Character-level tokenization â€“ Processes text without predefined word boundaries.
âœ… Efficient training â€“ Uses AdamW optimizer and dropout for better generalization.
âœ… End-to-end pipeline â€“ Includes training, inference, and dataset preprocessing scripts.



Hello, this is a sample text generated by a character-level Transfo
rmer model. It learns from data and predicts new sequences base
d on the context of characters.
